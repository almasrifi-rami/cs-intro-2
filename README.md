# (MIT 6.0002) Introduction To Computational Thinking And Data Science

The repository includes assignments completed during my journey through the second part of the introduction to computer science course from MIT. The course was very interesting in the sense that it emphasized more the thinking part over the programming.

## Problem set 1

In this problem set, we get familiar with a few types of algorithms such as greedy and brute force and how they differ in their use and their results

## Problem set 2

This set was one of the most interesting in this course, focusing on the topic of graph optimization. While only the depth first and breadth first search algorithms were introduced, the explanation paves the way to explore different algorithms in the field of graph optimization.

## Problem set 3

This problem set was an introduction to random sampling, and statistics by trial (hacker statistics). Similar to random walks, the set emphasize on performing a certain random action (in this case robots cleaning rooms) and calculating relevant statistics based on a large number of trials.

## Problem set 4

An interesting follow-up to set 3, uses the previous knowledge, some basic statistics and the power of visualizations to model bacteria growth in human hosts.

## Problem set 5

In this set, we apply machine learning to climate change detection by using linear regression to model the temperatures in a certain year range. Then trying to predict the temperature in future years based on the models built.

## Final words

The course primarily focuses on different concepts that can be solved with computation, and data science. The programming assignments are easier to solve in comparison with the first course once you follow the concept introduced. Throughout the course, a recurring theme is the use of classes to model various types of objects from cows, nodes, graphs, bacteria, patients, robots, etc. It is very interesting to be guided on the use of classes in such a fascinating way that emphasizes the strength of object-oriented programming.
